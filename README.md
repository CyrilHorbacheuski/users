# Client & Server Application

Just a client-server application with the functionality of 
adding, deleting and viewing users

### Client
- React
- Typescript
- Apollo(GraphQL)
- MUI

To run the client application run
1. `cd client` 
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`
 
---
### Server
- Node.js
- Express
- GraphQL
- Sequelize
- MySQL

To run a server application you must have a **database** running.
In my case it is mysql but you can use any other dialect.
After the database is up, write in the console

1. `cd server` 
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run server`
